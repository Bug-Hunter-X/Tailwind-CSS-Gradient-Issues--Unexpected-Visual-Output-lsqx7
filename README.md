# Tailwind CSS Gradient Issues

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with gradients in Tailwind CSS.  Specifically, issues may arise from incorrectly specifying gradient directions, using incompatible colors, or using an older version of Tailwind that may not fully support gradient features. The `bug.js` file contains the code exhibiting the issue, while `bugSolution.js` offers a corrected version.

## Problem

The original code uses a linear gradient. If the gradient direction is not correctly specified or if the colors are not compatible, it may produce unexpected visual results, such as unexpected color transitions or missing parts of the gradient.

## Solution

The solution focuses on carefully specifying the gradient direction (`to-r`, `to-br`, etc.) and choosing compatible colors to ensure a smooth, visually appealing transition.  It also highlights the importance of using an updated version of Tailwind CSS to take advantage of the latest gradient improvements and bug fixes.
